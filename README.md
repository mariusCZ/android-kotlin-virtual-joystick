# android-kotlin-virtual-joystick
This is an example app of a virtual joystick coded in Kotlin for Android. I made this because other libraries were unmaintained and I needed a virtual joystick for another app.

I ported the code from Java to Kotlin from [bobnosn](https://github.com/bobnosn/joystick-view) work.
